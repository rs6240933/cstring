Suppose we want to print string

main(){
 
char s[10]={'R','I','S','H','\0'}; //\0 THIS IS null character which we have to give at last of every string
//suppose we want to print that arry string
for(i=0; s[i]!='\0'; i++)
   printf("%c",s[i]); //this loop run since we got null character
or we can use
printf("%s",s); %s helps to print whole string present in array without useing any loop
or we can use
puts(s); // this works same as print and also give new line
getch();

}


Suppose we want to enter name from user
main(){

char s[20];
int i;
printf("enetr the name");
   gets(s) //this is use to strore string in array and it will not take space aas end
puts(&s[0]);
        
}

gets()- it is a fun which address of first block of array to perform operation . So passing the array name (s) indicates we are passing first block address.
get(s)==get(&s[0]);
